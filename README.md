# Compliance5th 


This was a code challenge from Source Intelligence during my internship that customer and supplier view the application for their list compliances and requirements for applying for ISO certification. It's the same application - the views you see depends on whether you are a customer or supplier. If you are a customer, you would have sent requests  - if you are a supplier you would have received requests. I've  built it using  Angular, Npm,  Node.js and used firebase as a backend to live view the said App by visiting  https://compliance5th.firebaseapp.com/  and please be noted this is just the foundation with 75% its functionality and still under development I've hosted and deployed it in firebase for demo and CRUD testing.
